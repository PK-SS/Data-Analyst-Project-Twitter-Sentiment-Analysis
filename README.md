Twitter Sentiment Analysis 
Introduction 
 Natural Language Processing (NLP): The discipline of computer science, artificial 
intelligence and linguistics that is concerned with the creation of computational models 
that process and understand natural language. These include: making the computer 
understand the semantic grouping of words (e.g. cat and dog are semantically more 
similar than cat and spoon), text to speech, language translation and many more 
 Sentiment Analysis: It is the interpretation and classification of emotions (positive, 
negative and neutral) within text data using text analysis techniques. Sentiment analysis 
allows organizations to identify public sentiment towards certain words or topics. 
Approach: 
1. Data Preparation: 
 I start by loading the sentiment data from a CSV file using Pandas, selecting 
relevant columns, and refining the sentiment values for better understanding. 
2. Text Preprocessing: 
 Text data undergoes preprocessing steps such as converting to lowercase, 
removing URLs and special characters, lemmatization, and removing stopwords.  
3. Text Transformation: 
 The preprocessed text data is transformed into numerical vectors suitable for 
machine learning using the TfidfVectorizer from scikit-learn. This step converts 
text data into TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) numerical 
representations. 
4. Model Training and Evaluation: 
 Three different models for sentiment analysis: Bernoulli Naive Bayes, Linear 
Support Vector Classifier (SVC), and Logistic Regression. 
 Each model is trained using the transformed text data and corresponding 
sentiment labels. 
 Model evaluation is performed by calculating accuracy scores on a test dataset. 
5. Predictions and Results: 
 The trained models are utilized to make predictions on new text samples. 
 Predicted sentiment labels are stored along with the corresponding text samples 
in a Pandas DataFrame. 
 Descriptive labels ('Negative' and 'Positive') are assigned to sentiment labels for 
better interpretation. 
Conclusion: This project demonstrated how to perform sentiment analysis using logistic 
regression. By leveraging text preprocessing techniques, TF-IDF vectorization, and machine 
learning models,  was able to predict sentiment labels for text data accurately. This tutorial 
provides a foundational understanding of sentiment analysis techniques and serves as a 
practical guide for implementing sentiment analysis projects using Python and scikit-learn.
